Goromi Basic Javacord Bot
=======
The README file
_________________

This is the readme file for this repo. the project was created in IntelliJ IDEA. targeted for java 17. at the current moment i am unable to get the thing into a single working jar file. i can link the dependencies in the manifest and then zip everything together, but that defeats the point of a jar file. it is intended on just demonstrating i can make a java discord bot that works. all it does is see a specific message and respond to it at the moment.

why did i use javacord, becuase jda, discord 4j made things harder than they needed to be. as to why this is an IntelliJ IDEA project. well, i hate eclipse, because i have had plenty of problems doing simple stuff. plus its ugly and confusing. and i simply have no desire to use netbeans, hence IntelliJ IDEA.
