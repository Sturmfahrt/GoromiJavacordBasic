Goromi Basic Javacord Bot
=======
The README file
_________________

This is the readme file for this repo. the project was created in IntelliJ IDEA. targeted for java 17. unlike previous commit i have successfully managed to get the god forsaken thing to build a fat jar that works.

why did i use javacord, becuase jda, discord 4j made things harder than they needed to be. as to why this is an IntelliJ IDEA project. well, i hate eclipse, because i have had plenty of problems doing simple stuff. plus its ugly and confusing. and i simply have no desire to use netbeans, hence IntelliJ IDEA.

i think the next thing i will do is a music discord bot that will be called Goromi.
