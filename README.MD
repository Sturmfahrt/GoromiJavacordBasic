Goromi Basic Javacord Bot
=======
The README file
_________________

This is the readme file for this repo. the project was created in IntelliJ IDEA. targeted for java 17. at the current moment i am unable to get the thing into a single working jar file. i can link the dependencies in the manifest and then zip everything together, but that defeats the point of a jar file. it is intended on just demonstrating i can make a java discord bot that works. all it does is see a specific message and respond to it at the moment.

why did i use javacord, because jda, discord 4j made things harder than they needed to be. as to why this is an IntelliJ IDEA project. well, i hate eclipse, because i have had plenty of problems doing simple stuff. plus its ugly and confusing. and i simply have no desire to use netbeans, hence IntelliJ IDEA.

and yes i am aware the token is there. if this is ever made public i will have made it so that where ever the token is stored is ignored by git as well as just simply resetting the bot token.

i should mention the source of a singular working independent jar file is java complaining about signatures. why this keeps happening i have no idea.
